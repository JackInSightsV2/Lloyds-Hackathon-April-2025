# ðŸ§  AI Agent Task Log

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in markdown to track what the agent is working on.

---

## Task File Creation

- Create a markdown file in the project root:
  - Use `TASKS.md` or a specific name like `FEATURE_CHAT.md`
  - One file per feature or focus area

---

## Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] Describe something the agent has fully implemented
- [x] Another finished item

## ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks

## Notes
